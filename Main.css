/* main.css */

/*
  This file is intended for custom CSS rules that are *not* handled
  by Tailwind CSS utility classes or the @layer directives defined
  in index.html's <style type="text/tailwindcss"> block.

  When using the Tailwind CDN script, the primary styling (including
  utility classes and custom @layer rules) is processed directly
  from the HTML file.

  You can add standard CSS rules here if needed for specific overrides
  or complex selectors not easily achievable with Tailwind utilities.

/* Example custom rule (uncomment to use): */
/*
body {
  font-smooth: always;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
